This git includes only source code of the program, for it to work you also need to have catalog named "adb" next to your executable, and inside of it files named "adb.exe", "AdbWinApi.dll" and "AdbWinUsbApi.dll", you can get them from Android SDK or compile them yourself from the sources on Android Open Source Project.

Additionally you need to have debugging over USB enabled.
